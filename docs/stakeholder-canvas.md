# Stakeholder Alignment Canvas – Template

Map the people (or roles) who rely on your product so you understand how outages, security incidents, or delays impact them. Keep this canvas next to your North Star doc and update it whenever expectations shift.

## How to Use

1. List every stakeholder group—internal teams, customers, investors, compliance officers, support staff.
2. Capture what they care about most so you can prioritize communication and tooling.
3. Note preferred check-in cadences and channels to avoid surprises when incidents happen.
4. Record current risks or open questions to close as you harden the product.

| Stakeholder / Role | Why They Care | What “Success” Looks Like | Communication Cadence & Channel | Risks / Open Questions | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Customer success lead | Needs reliable onboarding flows to avoid churn | <2% onboarding failure rate; 1-hour SLA on fixes | Weekly async update in Slack; monthly Zoom review | Unsure if international customers hit geo-specific issues | Teo |
| Compliance advisor | Ensures data flows meet regional regulations | Documented data inventory; GDPR DPIA complete | Quarterly security review call; ad-hoc email for blockers | Need confirmation on data residency for analytics stack | Lucas |

**Tips**

- Group similar users if the list gets long (e.g., “early adopter customers”).  
- Link to related docs or dashboards so every stakeholder has context when you share updates.  
- Revisit the canvas after major roadmap shifts, funding events, or new integrations.
